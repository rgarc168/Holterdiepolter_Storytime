You would not believe what happened to me in the ratskeller.
I wish every Montag was a holiday while I am in school.
Let's talk about it at the Biergarten over a plate of Doner kebabs.
On one hand, BMWs are great because most of their models can fit at least one large-sized hund. 
Every Freitag I like to treat myself to Gebaeck and Bratwurst.
Oh mein Gott, I spilled beer on my Lederhose!
Always a tough decision, which to drive a BMW or Porsche.
Lederhose wettbewerbsfaehig against Dirndel wins because they are beer resistant.
What a relief, I would hate to walk down the Hauptstrasse with beer soaked clothes.
Beer soaked clothes would have surely attracted hunds by the dozen.
I heard barking. Lots and lots of barking. Die Hunde are coming for me.
// There is a line that goes here before
Throwing Gebaeck at die Hunde made me hungry. All I could think about is eating a Apfelkuchen.
