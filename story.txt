You would not believe what happened to me in the ratskeller.
I wish every Montag was a holiday while I am in school.
Let's talk about it at the Biergarten over a plate of Doner kebabs.
On one hand, BMWs are great because most of their models can fit at least one large-sized hund. 
Every Freitag I like to treat myself to Gebaeck and Bratwurst.
Oh mein Gott, I spilled beer on my Lederhose!
Always a tough decision, which to drive a BMW or Porsche.
Lederhose wettbewerbsfaehig against Dirndel wins because they are beer resistant.
What a relief, I would hate to walk down the Hauptstrasse with beer soaked clothes.
Beer soaked clothes would have surely attracted hunds by the dozen.
Without the beer resistance, I would have to throw Gebaecks towards the hunds to throw them off my trail.
Alas, the resisttance of my lederhose was not enough.
I heard barking. Lots and lots of barking. Die Hunde are coming for me.
In order to fend off the hunds, I quickly started hurling Gebaeck to draw them away from me.
Throwing Gebaeck at die Hunde made me hungry. All I could think about is eating a Apfelkuchen.
Now I start walking going on the Hauptstrasse to find a Baeckerei with Klimaanlage.
In Berlin they have many Klimaanlage buildings than places out of the cities.
After searching, I finally found a Baeckerei with Klimaanlage.
I bought some more Gebaeck since I had to fight off those hunds earlier. 
I said Danke to the waiter after he brought me Bratwurst.
Then I hopped in my Porsche and sped off down the road.
Finally, I found a Backerei with Klimaanlage but unfortunately they are closed on Freitag.
